#1. What is an Abstract Class?

##    a. Similar to interfaces but cannot be instantiated.
##    b. Can contain code or data.
##    c. Class can inherit from only one abstract class.

###** If you have logic that will be the same for all the derived classes, use abstract class, otherwise you may want to use an interface.
